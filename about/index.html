	Monotask can't make you more passionate about what you do.

Monotask can't magically eliminate all distractions from your life.

Monotask can't do your work for you.

**But if you care about your work, and about getting it done, Monotask can help remove obstacles that get in the way of concentrating.**

### What Monotask Does

Monotask is a small piece of software. It works kind of like a calendar. You tell it when you want to be in a certain working mode, and which websites might be distracting you when you're in that work mode. Monotask then makes those sites unavailable to you, so you can focus on your work.

### The Team Behind Monotask

We're two often-distractible guys, based in Virginia.

**Charlie** focuses on the front-end, the design, and the general user experience of Monotask. **Tony** focuses on the back-end programming that makes Monotask work.

### What This Blog Is About

The Monotask blog is about three things.

#### First, it's about sharing stories of what it's like to start a startup

There are a lot of unknowns when starting a startup.

* Is the problem we're tackling one that's worth solving?
* Is there a market for this thing we're building?
* When should we release it?
* How should we market it?
* How do we know what to make better about it?
* What steps do we need to take -- as a *business* -- to improve the thing we're building?

We want to write down how we're addressing those questions, both for our benefit and for the benefit of others starting startups.


#### Second, it's about sharing new features that we're releasing that make Monotask better

Pretty obvious ... we need a platform to tell you about what we've done to make Monotask easier to use, more powerful, and so on.

Some features we talk about are new, others are features that a lot of users haven't discovered yet.

#### Third, it's about keeping us motivated and clear about what we're working on

So, we're both really distractible. That's kept us from getting Monotask launched as quickly as we should have. We appreciate the irony.

The blog is a place where we can note the important things that we're working on -- or that we want to work on.


### How to Get In Touch With Us

E-mail is probably the most sure route -- [contact@monotask.com](mailto:contact@monotask.com). You can also send us a note on Twitter [@monotask](http://twitter.com/monotask).

We're available to talk by phone or IM with reporters looking to discuss topics of **attention management**, **tools to help you focus**, or **ways of working better**.
