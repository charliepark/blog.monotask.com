	<p>Monotask can&#8217;t make you more passionate about what you do.</p>

<p>Monotask can&#8217;t magically eliminate all distractions from your life.</p>

<p>Monotask can&#8217;t do your work for you.</p>

<p><strong>But if you care about your work, and about getting it done, Monotask can help remove obstacles that get in the way of concentrating.</strong></p>

<h3 id='what_monotask_does'>What Monotask Does</h3>

<p>Monotask is a small piece of software. It works kind of like a calendar.</p>

<p>You tell it when you want to be in a certain working mode, and which websites might distract you when you&#8217;re in that work mode. Monotask then makes those sites unavailable to you, so you can focus on your work.</p>

<h3 id='the_team_behind_monotask'>The Team Behind Monotask</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re two often-distractible guys, based in Virginia.</p>

<p><strong>Charlie</strong> focuses on the front-end, the design, and the general user experience of Monotask. <strong>Tony</strong> focuses on the back-end programming that makes Monotask work.</p>

<h3 id='what_this_blog_is_about'>What This Blog Is About</h3>

<p>The Monotask blog is about three things.</p>

<h4 id='first_its_about_sharing_stories_of_what_its_like_to_start_a_startup'>First, it&#8217;s about sharing stories of what it&#8217;s like to start a startup</h4>

<p>There are a lot of unknowns when starting a startup.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the problem we&#8217;re tackling one that&#8217;s worth solving?</li>

<li>Is there a market for this thing we&#8217;re building?</li>

<li>When should we release it?</li>

<li>How should we market it?</li>

<li>How do we know what to make better about it?</li>

<li>What steps do we need to take &#8211; as a <em>business</em> &#8211; to improve the thing we&#8217;re building?</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to write down how we&#8217;re addressing those questions, both for our benefit and for the benefit of others starting startups.</p>

<h4 id='second_its_about_sharing_new_features_that_were_releasing_that_make_monotask_better'>Second, it&#8217;s about sharing new features that we&#8217;re releasing that make Monotask better</h4>

<p>Pretty obvious &#8230; we need a platform to tell you about what we&#8217;ve done to make Monotask easier to use, more powerful, and so on.</p>

<p>Some features we talk about are new, others are features that a lot of users haven&#8217;t discovered yet.</p>

<h4 id='third_its_about_keeping_us_motivated_and_clear_about_what_were_working_on'>Third, it&#8217;s about keeping us motivated and clear about what we&#8217;re working on</h4>

<p>So, we&#8217;re both really distractible. That&#8217;s kept us from getting Monotask launched as quickly as we should have. We appreciate the irony.</p>

<p>The blog is a place where we can note the important things that we&#8217;re working on &#8211; or that we want to work on.</p>

<h3 id='how_to_get_in_touch_with_us'>How to Get In Touch With Us</h3>

<p>E-mail is probably the most sure route &#8211; <a href='mailto:contact@monotask.com'>contact@monotask.com</a>. You can also send us a note on Twitter <a href='http://twitter.com/monotask'>@monotask</a>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re available to talk by phone or IM with reporters looking to discuss topics of <strong>attention management</strong>, <strong>tools to help you focus</strong>, or <strong>ways of working better</strong>.</p>
