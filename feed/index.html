				<p>Monotask is a curious bit of software. Most software extends your computer in some novel way. Monotask, though? Essentially, Monotask takes what your computer&#8217;s supposed to do (go online without any issues), and it breaks it. Then, after a bit, it fixes it again.</p>

<p>Because Monotask is <em>breaking</em> your computer, we&#8217;ve been very careful about getting it out to beta testers. Actually, no. That&#8217;s a nice-sounding lie. I&#8217;ll speak for myself here: <strong>I&#8217;ve been <em>scared</em> to get it out to beta testers</strong>. And that&#8217;s the first step of a dangerous spiral:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m anxious about getting it out to users and having it break their computer.</li>

<li>I don&#8217;t send it out to beta users.</li>

<li>We don&#8217;t get feedback on the software.</li>

<li>Having no feedback from outside users, we&#8217;re limited in how we can fix it.</li>

<li>GO TO STEP 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s a cycle we need to break.</p>

<p>So. Beginning as soon as I publish this post, I&#8217;m going to reach out to the next five beta users on our beta list. The goal: Get them using Monotask, on a free account, and giving us feedback on how the client app works.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to post my exact e-mail message in my next post, but here&#8217;s the crux of what I need to convey:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monotask works on our own computers</li>

<li>Monotask <em>should</em> work on <em>your</em> computer</li>

<li>here&#8217;s the download link</li>

<li>we&#8217;re trying to find the rough edges where Monotask isn&#8217;t working</li>

<li>if it doesn&#8217;t work and you need to uninstall it, here are some instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether we get good feedback or not, my intention is to send it to five more beta testers a day, until we&#8217;ve exhausted the list or launched out of beta.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to be a beta tester (or if you&#8217;re a beta tester and haven&#8217;t heard from me yet when you read this), send me an e-mail and let me know: <a href='mailto:charlie@monotask.com'>charlie@monotask.com</a>. I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>

				<p>One of the things that I most admire about <a href='http://startuplessonslearned.com'>Eric Ries</a> and the whole &#8220;Lean Startup&#8221; movement is how much of a focus there is on <em>learning</em>. People often interpret &#8220;lean&#8221; to mean &#8220;cheap&#8221;, or misattribute the quote &#8220;fail fast&#8221;. As Eric says, though, it&#8217;s not about <em>failing</em> faster, but about <em>learning</em> faster.</p>

<p>This post isn&#8217;t a claim that we&#8217;ve figured out how to learn faster, but that it&#8217;s something we aspire to do, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m hoping to write more about in the near future. We&#8217;ll look at things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do we learn?</li>

<li>what kinds of questions should we ask?</li>

<li>what research methods should we employ?</li>

<li>what do we then <em>do</em> with the data?</li>

<li>how do we learn how to learn? (how do we improve the process?)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring all this more, and to sharing it with you. For now, though &#8230; back to work.</p>

		<title>An Intro to the Blog</title>

				<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>We just wanted to give a quick intro, and then get back to work building Monotask.</p>

<h3 id='who_we_are'>Who We Are</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re Charlie (<a href='http://twitter.com/charliepark'>@charliepark</a>) and Tony (<a href='http://twitter.com/mogrify'>@mogrify</a>).</p>

<p>We&#8217;re building Monotask. It&#8217;s attention management software. That means it helps you get to work. We&#8217;ll write more about it in future posts.</p>

<h3 id='what_were_doing_here'>What We&#8217;re Doing Here</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve been working on Monotask for a while now. A few years, honestly. We&#8217;re getting ready to share it with the world, but we&#8217;ve been hitting a few roadblocks. This blog is a place where we can update beta testers about the app and what we&#8217;re working on.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also a place where we can note things that we need to address with the app, log feedback from users, and, in general, be more transparent.</p>

<p>Starting a startup is hard, especially, when it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t focus on full-time. As we go through it, we want to share some of the lessons we&#8217;re learning, the challenges we&#8217;re facing, and the victories we&#8217;re celebrating.</p>

<h3 id='thats_it_for_now'>That&#8217;s It For Now</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll be posting again, soon. We just wanted to get this first post out there, to say hi and all that. If you want to check out Monotask, you can do that at <a href='http://monotask.com'>Monotask.com</a>.</p>

<p>More soon.</p>
